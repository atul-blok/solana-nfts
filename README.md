# Solana-nfts
Here, I'm going to discuss the three major ways to mint NFTs in Solana with metadata - 

```
1. Using RUST crates with the Solana program.
2. Using Javascript SDK of Solana with Metaplex.
3. Using Metaplex Candy Machine with Sugar.
```

# NFT Minting using Anchor & Rust Cartes 

## Approach 

- In this approach of minting NFT on Solana blockchain (devnet), we are creating a simple anchor (a development framework on Solana) project using - 
``anchor init mint-nft``
- After creating Minting we are updating [Anchor.toml](./mint-nft/Anchor.toml) with **devnet** and **keypair** path. 
- In [lib.rs](./mint-nft/programs/mint-nft/src/lib.rs) program file, we are creating these accounts to start minting - 
    - First, we need to create a mint account that is used to store the supply of tokens and used as a token for example - [above-minted-nft](https://explorer.solana.com/address/8oSTEMhuRdXW7hSoC1AfW8maQYYZ3PiaMUo8FYozW4Nw?cluster=devnet)
    - Second, we create a token account that contains about minter, owner, and total token balance for example -[above-token-acc](https://explorer.solana.com/address/ELy8bXN6zV4Lvp9eMG1L93GcVDvxzAi7eiKzJKfUkmZW?cluster=devnet)
    - Third, the Metaplex Metadata account that is used to store token URI and data for NFT with Metaplex - 
    [metadata-acc](https://explorer.solana.com/address/7GvqzemwNkWRHWMxcBZhxZGSiBaH5tDWohBSqNoUSsW1?cluster=devnet)  
    - Fourth, Metaplex MasterEdition account that doesn't contain any data but creates [print](https://docs.metaplex.com/resources/definitions#print) to make the copy of NFT to the owner. 

- After the program builds & deploys using ``` anchor build && anchor deploy```, we can use a [anchor-client](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor) to call actions to mint the program, we can mint multiple NFTs from a single program.  

- This approach would work with lots of development of the Solana program. 

#### Example

Program-code - [mint-nft](./mint-nft/programs/mint-nft/src/lib.rs)

Client-code to mint NFT - [call-from-client](./mint-nft/app/) 
- add your keypair to [guideSecret.json](./mint-nft/app/guideSecret.json) file

#### Costs & Stats 

| Command | Example Balance | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before Deployment | `4.453909 SOL` | It's balanced before deploying the above code on devnet. |
| After Deployment | `0.69303344 SOL` | It's the remaining balance of the account after deployment. `3.76087556 SOL`  used to create all accounts i.e. Mint, Token, Metadata, etc.|
| Before Minting 1 card with Metadata | `4.67086065 SOL` | It's the balance of the account before pushing the Mint transaction on the chain. |
| After Minting 1 card with Metadata | `4.64764105 SOL` | Remaining balance after minting 1 card with this approach using Metaplex account with metadata. |

#### Advantages
- It's a customizable Solana program where we can make copy the actual SPL token contract for minting & setting up the metadata accounts. 
- We can add metadata updates directly from the Solana program.
- It's a cost-effective and customizable development solution for NFT marketplaces. 
- We can add our own secondary sales actions or functions to this program for future uses. 

#### Disadvantages
- Solanaâ€™s contract NFT is that it is difficult to tie all the NFTs in the collection together.
- Multiple accounts & programs for all things like - Mint account, Initialization mint account, metadata account, and Metaplex account. and difficult to manage and understand all things at a time. 
- There is fixed memory space allocation for every account that's why it little bit complicated to manage data bytes stored in CPI(CROSS PROGRAM INNOVATION) account.
- It's complicated to calculate the program size before deployment. 

#### Rent & Transaction fee 
- The average cost for Solana transaction fee is - $ 0.00025 per transaction. It depends on the size of the transaction hash. 
- To get the rent per epoch & size of contract  -

# NFT Minting using Javascript SDK 

## Approach 
- In this approach, we are going to mint an NFT with metadata to Solana's devnet using the [Solana Web3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/web3.js) library and [Metaplex JS SDKs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@metaplex-foundation/js)
- We are uploading image/off-chain (stored [here](./nft-sdk/uploads/image.png)) data to Arweavez(bundle storage) and fetching its URI.
- In this approach we uploading all Metaplex [metadata](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/token-metadata/token-standard#the-non-fungible-standard) & Token Uri to NFT using Metaplex SDK. 
- After setting all these functions we are Mint NFT using Metaplex SDK.

#### Example
- SDK functions - [Minting NFT with SDK](./nft-sdk/app.ts)

#### Costs & Stats 

| Setps | Example Balance | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before starting mining & uploading | `4.623570034 SOL` | It's balanced before minting and uploading metadata script on devnet. |
| Step 1 - Uploading Image & metadata on Arweave | `4.623570034 SOL` | It's the remaining balance of the account after uploading the image, metadata, etc. The current cost to store the 1KB file is 0.0000014908690623249299 SOL or 0.000002233957 AR |
| Before Minting 1 card with Metadata | `4.623570034 SOL` | It's account balance before pushing Mint transaction on the chain. |
| After Minting 1 card with Metadata | `4.611553239 SOL` | Remaining balance after minting 1 card with this approach using Metaplex account with metadata. It uses almost `0.012016795 SOL` to mint an NFT with metadata.|

#### Advantages
1. This approach is very easy to use and does not need too much knowledge about the Rust and Solana networks. 
2. This approach is easy to integrate with the client and good to upload and update the metadata easily using SDK only. 
3. Cost of avg. minting 1 NFT using this is very cheap and effective to launch. 
4. No need to pay your own program deployment cost and set up all accounts for minting. It uses an already deployed program to create and mint NFT. 

#### Disadvantages
1. Hard to customize our functionality on the chain. 
2. Depend only on SDK library, may not work if any major changes in SDK occur. 
3. It's hard to calculate the all space, rent, and fees using this. 
4. Not able to mint multiple NFTS in a collection.

#### Rent & Transaction fee 
- The average cost of Minting an NFT in Solana is 0.00001 SOL.
- Cost for the above example to mint 1 NFT is `0.012016795 SOL` including the transaction fee. 

# NFT Minting using Metaplex Candy Machine with Sugar

## Approach 
- In this approach, we are using Candy Machine V2 and Sugar-CLI to mint and deploy the Collection to choose a random NFT from that collection with a specific  `#number` and minting address.
- This approach is well defined for all multiple NFT grouping and bunching in a single Candy machine and is able to mint an NFT from that Candy so there is no need to pay the same NFT metadata Cost to upload its already integrated Arweave service to upload the token URI and local images with a meager SOL fee.

#### Example
- For the above [example](./nft-sugar/) we are using [sugar-cli](https://docs.metaplex.com/developer-tools/sugar/) for the deploy a Candy Machine and minting the NFTs.
- We are setting up the config file already in a given pattern provided by Candy Machine Docs.
- [Assets](./nft-sugar/assets/) this folder contain all images according to the corresponding `.json` file with the specific collection.
- [Config.json](./nft-sugar/config.json) this file is used to the setting up all configurations of collection for the above assets provided in a collection.
- Some important doc to integrate this approach and minting NFT are given [here](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solana-development/how-to-deploy-an-nft-collection-on-solana-using-sugar-candy-machine)  

#### Costs & Stats 
| Setps | Example Balance | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Before starting mining & uploading | `4.611503335 SOL` | It's balanced before minting and uploading metadata script on devnet. |
| Step 1 - Uploading Image & metadata on Arweave | `4.611445527 SOL` | It's the remaining balance of the account after uploading the image, metadata, etc. The current cost to store the 1KB file is 0.0000014908690623249299 SOL or 0.000002233957 AR. Sugar used all collection NFT's metadata for the above collection is `0.000057808 SOL` |
| Deployment of Candy machine with collection | `4.574254127 SOL` | It's a balance of the account after deploying the candy machine on the chain. |
| Before Minting 1 card with Metadata | `4.574254127 SOL` | It's the balance of the account before pushing the Mint transaction on the chain. |
| After Minting 1 card with Metadata | `4.562272927 SOL` | Remaining balance after minting 1 card with this approach using Candy Machine with Random NFT from the whole collection. It uses almost `0.01198120 SOL` to mint an nft with metadata.|

#### Advantages
1. This approach is useful to work with multiple collections and a bunch of NFT minting and metadata update.
2. Here we can filter NFT using mint-address from a whole collection.
3. In this approach we fix the supply and make copies of the same collection NFT and check the metadata for the same collection.
4. In this approach, collection can be updated for all NFTs and get all NFTs with a specific condition and it's easy and secure to choose a random NFT from a bunch of NFTs. 
5. It can be helpful to make our own marketplace and list more NFTs with the same pattern.

#### Disadvantages
1. Not able to customize core functions and features of NFT. 
2. Not able to increase NFT supply for a candy machine or collection to mint.
3. Rent and balance calculation for each NFT consumption to mint that NFT. 

#### Rent & Transaction fee 
It takes almost  `0.000057808 SOL` to deploy a simple collection Candy Machine. 
And take `0.01198120 SOL` to mint an NFT using this approach with all NFT minting. 

> **_NOTE:_**  We are figuring out the solution for deployment Candy Machine & Minting NFT direct from Node Js/ Typescript.
